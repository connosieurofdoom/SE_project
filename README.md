### How to run the code.

Please run the code in the following order:

1. NER.ipynb ->         \
    1.1. NER_sentence.ipynb     \
    1.2. NER_words.ipynb        
2. se-qrate.ipynb
3. XGBoost

Please provide the files produced as outputs for each of the steps to the consecutive steps as inputs.

Due to the hardware constraints and our own lack of understanding, we have simplified the model while trying to keep true to the original study to the best of our ability.
